# VQE_molecules

**A Pennylane-based adaptive VQE algorithm for computing ground state energies of closed-shell molecules.**

## Purpose
This repository provides a Jupyter notebook that implements an adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm using Pennylane. It's designed to calculate the ground state energy of closed-shell molecules.
